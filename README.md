Project Title: Ohm's Law Calculator

Objective:

Create a user-friendly Python program that calculates and displays the voltage (V), current (I), or resistance (R) using Ohm's Law.

Description: This project aims to develop a Python application that leverages Ohm's Law (V = IR) to compute electrical parameters. Users can input any two values among voltage (V), current (I), and resistance (R), and the program will calculate and display the third value. This tool can be useful for students, engineers, and hobbyists working with electronic circuits.

Features:

User Input: Allow users to input two known values (voltage, current, or resistance).

Calculation: Automatically compute the unknown value using Ohm's Law.

Error Handling: Include error checks for invalid inputs (e.g., non-numeric values, negative numbers).

User Interface: Simple text-based interface for input and output.

Tools and Technologies:

Python 3.x
